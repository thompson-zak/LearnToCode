Can you help her by writing a Python program that calculates the average of the grades?</p>\n\n<b>Outline of Steps</b>\n<hr>\n<ol>\n<li>Create an array of grades.</li>\n<li>Calculate the sum of all the grades in the array.</li>\n<li>Find the total number of grades in the array.</li>\n<li>Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of grades.</li>\n<li>Print out the average of the grades.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<b>Code Sample</b>\n<hr>\n\n```python\n# Create an array of grades\ngrades = [85, 90, 70, 95, 80]\n\n# Calculate the sum of all the grades in the array\nsum_of_grades = sum(grades)\n\n# Find the total number of grades in the array\nnum_of_grades = len(grades)\n\n# Calculate the average by dividing the sum by the total number of grades\naverage = sum_of_grades / num_of_grades\n\n# Print out the average of the grades\nprint(\"The average of the grades is:\", average)\n```\n\n<b>Explanation</b>\n<hr>\n<p>In this program, we start by creating an array called grades that holds the list of numbers. We then calculate the sum of all the grades in the array using the sum() function. Next, we find the total number of grades in the array by using the len() function. After that, we calculate the average of the grades by dividing the sum by the total number of grades. Finally, we print out the average of the grades to the console.</p>"
