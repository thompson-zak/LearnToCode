            " Define three variables: name, age, and favorite_color, and assign values to them.",

        "explanation": "- In this program, we start by defining three variables: `name`, `age`, and `favorite_color`.\n- The `name` variable is assigned the value `\"John Doe\"`, representing your name.\n- The `age` variable is assigned the value `25`, representing your age.\n- The `favorite_color` variable is assigned the value `\"blue\"`, representing your favorite color.\n- We use the `print` statements to display the values stored in each variable.\n- The first `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"My name is\" and the value of the `name` variable.\n- The second `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"I am\", the value of the `age` variable, and the string \"years old\".\n- The third `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"My favorite color is\" and the value of the `favorite_color` variable.\n\nWhen you run the program, it will output:\n```\nMy name is John Doe\nI am 25 years old\nMy favorite color is blue\n```\n\nThis simple exercise demonstrates how to define variables, assign values to them, and use print statements to display the stored values."
