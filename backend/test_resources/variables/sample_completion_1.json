                "content": "<hr>\n<b>Prompt:</b> \nWrite a program in Python to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Outline of steps:</b>\n1. Define two variables to store the length and width of the rectangle.\n2. Assign specific values to the variables.\n3. Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.\n4. Display the calculated area using a print statement.\n\n<hr>\n<b>Code Sample:</b>\n\n```python\n# Step 1: Define variables for length and width\nlength = 5\nwidth = 3\n\n# Step 2: Assign specific values\n# Here, length = 5 and width = 3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area\narea = length * width\n\n# Step 4: Display the calculated area\nprint(\"The area of the rectangle is: \", area)\n```\n\n<hr>\n<b>Explanation:</b>\n1. The code begins by defining two variables, `length` and `width`, to store the length and width of the rectangle, respectively.\n2. In this example, the length is assigned the value 5, and the width is assigned the value 3.\n3. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length and width together. This calculation is performed by assigning the result to the variable `area`.\n4. Finally, the calculated area is displayed using a print statement, with an appropriate message to provide context.\n\nNote: Since there are no input statements and the values for length and width are directly assigned in the code, the output will always be the same. However, variables can be modified to input values from the user if desired."
