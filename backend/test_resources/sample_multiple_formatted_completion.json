        "prompt": "Write a program in Python to calculate the area of a rectangle given its length and width.",
        "outline": [
            " Define two variables to store the length and width of the rectangle.",
            " Assign specific values to the variables.",
            " Calculate the area of the rectangle using the formula: area = length * width.",
            " Display the calculated area using a print statement."
        ],
        "code": "```python\n# Step 1: Define variables for length and width\nlength = 5\nwidth = 3\n\n# Step 2: Assign specific values\n# Here, length = 5 and width = 3\n\n# Step 3: Calculate the area\narea = length * width\n\n# Step 4: Display the calculated area\nprint(\"The area of the rectangle is: \", area)\n```",
        "explanation": "1. The code begins by defining two variables, `length` and `width`, to store the length and width of the rectangle, respectively.\n2. In this example, the length is assigned the value 5, and the width is assigned the value 3.\n3. The area of a rectangle can be calculated by multiplying its length and width together. This calculation is performed by assigning the result to the variable `area`.\n4. Finally, the calculated area is displayed using a print statement, with an appropriate message to provide context.\n\nNote: Since there are no input statements and the values for length and width are directly assigned in the code, the output will always be the same. However, variables can be modified to input values from the user if desired."

    "2": {
        "prompt": "Create a simple program that prints your name, age, and favorite color.",
        "outline": [
            " Define three variables: name, age, and favorite_color, and assign values to them.",
            " Use print statements to display your name, age, and favorite color."
        ],
        "code": "```python\n# Step 1: Define variables\nname = \"John Doe\"\nage = 25\nfavorite_color = \"blue\"\n\n# Step 2: Print statements\nprint(\"My name is\", name)\nprint(\"I am\", age,\"years old\")\nprint(\"My favorite color is\", favorite_color)\n```",
        "explanation": "- In this program, we start by defining three variables: `name`, `age`, and `favorite_color`.\n- The `name` variable is assigned the value `\"John Doe\"`, representing your name.\n- The `age` variable is assigned the value `25`, representing your age.\n- The `favorite_color` variable is assigned the value `\"blue\"`, representing your favorite color.\n- We use the `print` statements to display the values stored in each variable.\n- The first `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"My name is\" and the value of the `name` variable.\n- The second `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"I am\", the value of the `age` variable, and the string \"years old\".\n- The third `print` statement displays a combination of the string \"My favorite color is\" and the value of the `favorite_color` variable.\n\nWhen you run the program, it will output:\n```\nMy name is John Doe\nI am 25 years old\nMy favorite color is blue\n```\n\nThis simple exercise demonstrates how to define variables, assign values to them, and use print statements to display the stored values."
