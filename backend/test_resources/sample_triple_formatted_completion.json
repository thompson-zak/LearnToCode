        "explanation": "This program starts by displaying a message asking the user to enter the length of the rectangle. The user's input for the length is stored in the variable \"length\". Then, a similar process occurs to gather the width from the user and store it in the variable \"width\". Later, the program calculates the area of the rectangle by multiplying the length and width, and stores the result in the variable \"area\". Finally, the program displays the calculated area to the user."
